                <div class="img1"></div>
                <p>The word "hundred" is actually derived from the Old Norse word "hundrath," which actually means 120, not 100. More specifically, "hundrath," in Old Norse, means "long hundred," which equals 120, due to the duodecimal system. But good luck trying to argue that your $100 bill is worth 20 percent more than it is.</p>

                <p>Surely, you remember the Pythagorean Theorem from your 10th grade geometry class, but have you ever heard of Pythagoras' Constant? Well, here's the lowdown: The square root of 2 (1.41) is known as Pythagoras' Constant. It's also the very first irrational number ever to be discovered.</p>

                </p>
                <div class="img4"></div>
                <p>There are a total of zero zeros in Roman numerals. While the ancient Greeks were aware of zero as a concept, they didn't consider zero to be a number at all. For example, Aristotle decided zero wasn't a number because you couldn't divide by zero. Instead of a Roman numeral, the Latin word "nulla" would have been used to represent the concept of zero. The reason no numeral existed for zero is because there was no need for a numeral to represent it.</p>

                <p class="title">5.Different Cultures Discovered Zero at Different Times.</p>
                <div class="img5"></div>
                <p>The idea of zero as a number was invented throughout the world at different times in history. Despite this scattered adoption, it's generally accepted that the Indian astronomer and mathematician Brahmagupta brought up the concept of zero for the first time, around 600 A.D. Besides this, Brahmagupta contributed a lot to mathematics and astronomy, and is known for explaining how to find the cube and cube-root of an integer and also gave rules facilitating the computation of squares and square roots.</p>

                <p class="title">6.Roman Numerals Were Invented as a Means of Trading.</p>
                <div class="img6"></div>
                <p>The form of record-keeping was used as a means for Romans to easily price different goods and services, and were widely used throughout the Roman Empire for everyday processes. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Roman numerals still continued to be used throughout Europe. This stopped, however, around the 1600s. Roman numerals are represented by seven different letters: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.</p>

                <p class="title">7.Zero Is An Even Number.</p>
                <div class="img7"></div>
                <p>Mathematically, an even number is one that can be divided by two and still create a whole number. Zero meets the criteria for this because if you halve zero, you get zero. But if you're confused, you're not alone: Research from the 1990s, out of Cambridge University, actually revealed that people are 10 percent slower at deciding whether zero is even or not than they are if, say, two is.</p>

                <p>Have you ever heard that the number 9 is considered to be a "magic" number? No? Well it is, and here is why: if you multiply a number by 9 and add all the digits of the new number together, the sum will always add up to 9.</p>

                <div class="img10"></div>
                <p>Since the volume of a cylinder is PI, times the radius squared, times height, that would mean a pizza with radius "Z" and height "A" would have the volume of… PI * z * z * a.</p>
